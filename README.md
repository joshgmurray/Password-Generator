# Password-Generator
## Challenge Description
For this challenge I was tasked with taking the starter code of a Password Generator that did not work when clicked, and adding to the HTML and JavaScript to fix the page to generate a password using symbols, lower and upper case letters, and numbers. The password must also be between 8-128 characters long.
## Acceptance Criteria
* Give the user options to include Symbols, Upper and lower case letters, numbers, or a combination of all three.
* Give the user the ability to generate a password between 8-128 characters
* Display the random passwords to the screen when the "Generate Password" button is clicked
## Work Completed
* Added User options of Upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols, to select when generating a password.
* Created a character limit of between 8-128 characters when choosing a password
* Updated HTML and CSS to show Password inside the intended password box when 'generate password' button is clicked, replacing the placeholder text.
* Added working links to my application images to navigate users to corresponding applications when clicked.
* Ensured that interface adapts to multiple screen sizes.
